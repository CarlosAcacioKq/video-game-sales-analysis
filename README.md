# Steam Game Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to gather, clean, and analyze Steam game data using the Steam API, Python scripts, and optional visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI. By the end of this project, you'll have a dataset of Steam games that you can explore, visualize, and expand upon for further analysis or even to build a future web application.

## Features

- **API-Based Data Collection:** Pulls game information (title, price, description, genres, publisher) directly from the Steam API.
- **Flexible Data Exploration:** Includes Python scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- **Extensible:** Easily add more analysis steps or integrate with a web application later.

## Getting a Steam API Key

1. **Create a Steam Account:**
   - If you do not already have one, sign up at [store.steampowered.com](https://store.steampowered.com/).

2. **Visit the Steam Web API Key Page:**
   - Go to [Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and log in with your Steam account.

3. **Register a Domain:**
   - Enter any domain name (for example, `localhost` or another placeholder) and click **Register**.

4. **Copy Your API Key:**
   - You will see a long string of charactersâ€”this is your personal Steam API key.  
   **Important:** Keep this key private and do not commit it to version control.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Create a .env File:

In the project's root directory, create a file named .env with the following content:

bash
Copy
STEAM_API_KEY=your_personal_steam_api_key_here
This file is typically ignored by Git (see .gitignore).

Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda) to avoid conflicts with global packages.
(Optional) Setup Visualization Tools:

If you plan to use Tableau or Power BI, install these tools separately.
Project Structure
bash

Build the Dataset:

Run the dataset-building script:
bash
Copy
python scripts/build_dataset_from_api.py
This will create steam_api_data_games.csv in the data/ folder.
Explore the Data:

Run the exploratory analysis script:
bash
Copy
python scripts/data_exploration.py
This script loads the CSV and prints out descriptive statistics, value counts, and other key insights.
Visualize:

Run the visualization script:
bash
Copy
python scripts/data_visualization.py
Generated plots (e.g., a histogram of prices, a bar chart of the top 10 most expensive games) are saved in the visuals/ folder.
(Optional) Create Interactive Dashboards:

Open Tableau or Power BI and connect to the CSV file (data/steam_api_data_games.csv).
Build interactive charts, filters, and dashboards based on your analysis.
Visualization & Dashboards
Python Plots: The generated plots are stored in the visuals/ folder.
Tableau/Power BI: Use these tools to create interactive dashboards by connecting them to the CSV file.
